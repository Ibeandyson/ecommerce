            <h5><b>Privacy Policy Scope</b></h5>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy identifies and describes the way Bellefu uses and protects the information we
                collect about users. All use of Bellefu products and services, as well as visits to our website, are
                subject to this Privacy Policy.
                We may collect different types of personal and other information based on your use of our services:

                </li>
                <li>
                    Investigating, preventing or taking action regarding illegal activities, violations of our Terms of
                    Service or Acceptable Use Policies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5><b>Online Activity Tracking</b></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We collect information about your activity in Bellefu applications and website for a number of
                    purposes using technologies such as cookies, user behaviour, and server log files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We use that information to help tailor the content you see on our site.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Personal data protection</b></p>
            <p>
                Bellefu treats the personal data of its users with the utmost responsibility. We believe that each user
                has the right to know how his personal data is used, the purposes of such use and how it is possible to
                stop the use of his or her data.
                We classify user personal data as anonymous (which cannot be associated with a living, existing person)
                and identifiable (which can be associated with a living, existing person). Anonymous data is collected
                and processed starting at the moment you visit our website. Identifiable data, in the other hand, is
                only collected and processed once we receive your explicit consent by accepting our Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <h5><b>Information Sharing</b></h5>
            <p>We may provide Personal Information to non-Bellefu companies or other third parties for purposes such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Complying with court orders and other legal process;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enforcing our agreements and property rights.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Additionally, when you complete a purchase with Bellefu service, we share your submitted shipping
                address
                and phone number for shipping purposes only. This information is shared with the entities fulfilling and
                shipping your order, such as the merchant and the shipping provider.
            </p>
            <h5><b>Anonymous & Aggregate Information</b></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We collect some information on an anonymous basis. We also may anonymize the personal information we
                    collect about you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We obtain aggregate data by combining anonymous data that meet certain criteria into groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We may share aggregate or anonymous information in various formats with trusted non-Bellefu
                    entities, and may work with those entities to do research and provide products and services.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5><b>Policy on Data Protection and Security</b></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We do not sell your Personal Information to anyone for any purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We maintain information about you in our business records while you are a user, or until it is no
                    longer needed for business, tax, or legal purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We have implemented encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect Personal
                    Information when stored or transmitted by Bellefu
                </li>
                <li>
                    We require non-Bellefu companies acting on our behalf to protect any Personal Information they may
                    receive in a manner consistent with this Policy. We do not allow them to use such information for
                    any other purpose.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5><b>Links to/from Other Web Sites</b></h5>
            <p>
                Bellefu is not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our website, nor the
                information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our

                rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
            </p>
            <h5><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b></h5>
